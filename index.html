        <h3>Welcome.</h3>
        <p>You may or may not be reading this, whether or not. If you truly are the Christian I've made this for, I was glad to cooperate and comply with the terms to construct this elegant yet simple site. Yet, I only ask; say, if you will, imply that you join us. Join this hub, as you will not regret it. I insist, I may so kindly suggest. After all, it's free!</p>
        <p>There is also a benefit such as the ability to make a remark on the wall (not online, i don't know JS; sorry!). This system gives into you, as you feed into it back. It is relative to capitalism, an ideal adopted in our home; America. You get depending on what you give; simple bargain. If you do not comply, you will be booted out of the hub. An example of a benefit is school lunch delivery for free. Despite no money being charged, you still are obliged to give into our system as we have clearly and kindly given to you.</p>
        <p id="green">So, will you join us? It's completely your choice.</p>
